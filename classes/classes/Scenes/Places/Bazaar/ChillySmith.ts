	// Sun, the Bizarre Bazaar's Weaponsmith/Blacksmith
	// A rather bare-bones version of the actual NPC I made, but eh
	// Anyways Sun's an unfriendly grump, much against what his name implies
	// He's a jaguar-morph. And a big wall of muscle. Also he has a boyfriend
	// Shop uses flag "MRAPIER_BOUGHT" so you can't buy multiple Midnight Rapiers
	// Said flag carries through ascension. Really, the weapon is too op to allow multiples
