Strange markings adorn the walls; a mixture of hieroglyphic sigils and etchings showing winged, reptilian beings - dragons, without a question of a doubt.

There are several other statues around, but all have been smashed and broken and graffitied to the point it’s hard to be sure what they originally were; the fountain only survived because someone or something feared interfering with its supply of water. A few scarred, chipped stone benches are scattered around the square. Here and there, you spot small puddles of green sludge, rapidly drying as the thick dust soaks them up.\n\n");
