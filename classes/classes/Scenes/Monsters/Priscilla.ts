She's wielding a crudely fashioned metal sword and a large metal square shield. She's wearing a spider-silk loincloth and the imp skulls hang from the leather strap holding her loincloth together. Her helmet is fashioned out of a minotaur skull and her chestpiece appears to be carved from minotaur ribcage. Her pauldrons are also fashioned from bones. Despite how well-armored she is, her lethicite-pierced nipples are exposed. It's obvious she has travelled quite a lot and slain a lot of minotaurs and imps.
