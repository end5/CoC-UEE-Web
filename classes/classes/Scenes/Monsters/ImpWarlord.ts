A pair of powerful wings extends out from his shoulders, however, you suspect he wouldn't be able to fly for long due to his extreme bulk.  A thick coating of fur starts at his well toned hips and works its way down his powerful legs.  His legs end in a pair of oddly jointed, demonic hooves.  His demonic figure is completed by a thin tail that has an arrowhead shaped tip.\n\nUnlike most imps, he is wearing a metal chestplate and bracers for protection. He doesn't appear to be wearing anything other than his armor and loincloth.  He wields a sword in his right hand and he doesn't appear to wield anything in his left hand, suggesting that he also attacks with his claws.";
