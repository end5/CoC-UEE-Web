A pair of stalks bearing gills originate along the median of their front torso, just below the collarbone, and grow downward along a diagonal. The branches do not move on their own and generally hang down when one stands upright out of water, falling over their breasts. A phallic-looking branch protrudes from their body near the ‘groin’ with a head flanged by diminutive writhing tentacles similar to the longer ones above, and a deep-blue vagina exists underneath with small feelers ringing the entrance. Both types of tentacles frequently make small shifts toward whatever the anemone’s currently interested in unless checked consciously by their bearer.");
			headerSub("History");
			outputText("Anemones are a mutant offshoot of a giant, drab-colored freshwater hydrozoan that has since been pushed to extinction. Anemones are a fairly new species in terms of Mareth’s chronology; only emerging from their non-sentient, non-humanoid precursors after the demon factory had adulterated the lake with chemicals for quite some time.");
			headerSub("Biology");
			outputText("Anemones have an internal construction more similar to jellyfish or their seafaring namesake than the humans they superficially resemble. Lacking a skeletal structure, most of their body is extremely elastic and supported by the autonomous inflation and deflation of thousands of tiny, interlinked bladders within the penultimate layers of the skin. The elasticity and compressibility help to resist the changes of pressure frequently incurred when the anemone transitions between surface and deeper water, and the bladders can be filled with air to no ill effect, allowing one to decrease weight and increase rigidity to remain above water when necessary. The topmost layer of the skin is a tough cuticle that prevents damage to the essential vessels underneath. The anemone’s tentacles share the same structure but with stinging nematocysts interspersed densely in the topmost layer of the skin. These stinging cells fire whenever in contact with any surface, even the anemone’s own, though she is immune to her own venom due to the outer cuticle. The venom injected by the cells retains the paralytic effects of the anemone’s ancestor but has been endowed with an aphrodisiac effect by long exposure to factory runoff. Anemones synthesize venom quickly enough that the larger tentacles cannot run out except in cases of severe lack of nutrition, leading to a downward spiral usually resulting in the death of the individual; venom reserves on the smaller tentacles can be depleted during overuse. The feelers surrounding the vagina are a degenerate form of the tentacles, retaining the venom but lacking the color. The anemone’s nervous system runs through her entire body, with a nexus in the head, roughly in the center of her nerve network. Sensory nerves are at their highest concentration in the face, the genitalia, the breasts, the gills, and the tips of the tentacles. Because the anemone’s elastic body is designed to resist pressure damage, an anemone is unlikely to find being pinned underneath a heavier creature in either mating or combat uncomfortable. However, applying sharp pressure or squeezing suddenly without giving the anemone’s body a chance to distribute the force will cause one to experience something similar to pain and likely provoke a defensive response. The same holds true of any bladed implement used with enough force to penetrate the cuticle.");
			headerSub("Diet");
			outputText("Anemone retain, for the most part, the dietary needs of their ancestors; they require the nutrients found in the bodily fluids of living creatures. The mutations wrought by the demonic corruption of the lake have modified the anemone’s digestive system to extract these nutrients efficiently from said fluids, particularly semen, to which anemones have developed a partiality, at the expense of eliminating their ability to subsist on any other food. Anemones have a high capacity to store nutrients and as such, are always psychologically hungry even if not physically in need of nourishment.");
			headerSub("Reproduction");
			outputText("Anemone reproduction favors warm, damp spaces. Anemones reproduce in a queer admixture of invertebrate and terrestrial modes and could be considered primarily parasitic in nature. Though not interfertile with other races, anemones tend to copulate with any female using the penile branch located at their groin; the haploid gametes released each have the potential to grow into a new anemone and will try to implant in the womb of the recipient. When one is successful, it emits a hormone that causes the other oocytes to die and be absorbed by the host’s body. The implantation follows the normal routine of pregnancy. Anemone are not particular about partners; if two anemone meet in this way and both have enough nutrition to support a pregnancy, they will typically copulate with each other, and the haploid oocyte implanted will be fertilized with additional genetic material inside the recipient’s body, resulting in true diploid sexual reproduction. The resultant offspring of any anemone ‘pregnancy’ will take the shape of a small, non-sentient, shaft, not dissimilar to the penile branch, that will search out nearby liquid if available and slowly begin taking on water to decrease the density of each cell and begin cell division and differentiation pursuant to becoming an adult anemone. The growth begins at the back of the shaft, where a dense nucleus of undiversified cells gathers. If no liquid is available the offspring will often try to parasitize its mother in order to survive on her bodily fluids, first adhering to the skin surface and then using pressure from cellular expansion to force its way through and connect with the circulatory and nervous systems. This process is irreversible; the undifferentiated cells die a preprogrammed death once the conduit is established. If no suitable female partner is available and food supplies abundant, as they often are with shoreline anemones living near male-heavy camps, an anemone can reproduce ‘asexually’ by masturbating herself to orgasm and placing the ejaculate in her own vagina. The success rate of such self-impregnation is fairly low. Anemones typically only do this for one generation; once an offspring emerges and is fully-grown, the anemone will prefer to copulate with it as long as it remains in the area. An anemone regarded as a cute pet or a sex toy by a predominately male community can quickly grow to plague it in this manner.");
			headerSub("Behavior");
			outputText("while they may have a fair bit of natural intelligence, they are very young as a species and by no means world-wise or accustomed to society. They have some talent for language but little exposure to it; most of their sparse language skills come from observing the interactions of others from faraway. Anemone tend to communicate with each other by touch or gesture and will usually default to this with other races, only using words to add emphasis or consciously with races that do not seem to respond to the myriad small cues that anemone recognize in each others’ actions. Anemones tend to be slightly mischievous or sadistic, either as result of their corrupt origins or simply because of their inexperience and lack of social mores.");

On Driders, the anus and corresponding “cheeks” are located just above the beginning of their spider half.

			headerSub("History");
			outputText("Spider-kin are a relatively new addition to Mareth. They were originally humans who came through a newly opened portal in the swamp. Unfortunately for those humans, they came into contact with a fairly rare variety of spider that infests that portion of the swamp known as “red widows” for their red coloration and poisonous venom. Like all creatures in Mareth, the red widows were changed as the demons claimed power, and their venom became somewhat less deadly, if more transformative. The newly arrived immigrants were bitten, one by one, each time changing more to resemble the spiders of their new homeland. After a few weeks of this, they had become spider-kin. They could not leave through the portal they had entered, and they had already developed strange new cravings. In spite of this, the new spider-kin established a small village around their portal and resolved not to eat other sentient creatures. They even began to trade with other villages, exchanging silk for foodstuffs and metals they could not procure in their swampy home. Before long, a few rogue arachne and Driders tired of this, and split off from their more peaceful brethren. They believed themselves a superior predator, and had no such qualms about eating other thinking beings. Once the demons began their conquest of the swamps, these renegades quickly joined them, wallowing in corruption to become even greater predators. Their more peaceful kin tried to fight, but were utterly defeated. Those who survived scattered throughout the swamp, eking out a far more feral life. Most of these survivors struggle with loneliness as much as their physical and sexual desires. It is recommended that the swamp be avoided by all but the stoutest adventurers for this reason – you never know if the spider you meet is merely lonely, lusty, or hungry. Thankfully prey is plentiful, and it is rare to find one of these spiders so hungry they’d rather eat you than converse or fuck.");
			headerSub("Reproduction");
			outputText("Spider-kin reproduction is a fairly standard affair. A male mates with a female, impregnating her eggs. One to two weeks later the mother will give birth to roughly one dozen eggs, which she will bind up in an egg sack and hang from a tree or cave ceiling. A week after that, immature spider-kin will emerge, ready to hunt. It takes roughly one month for them to reach their adult size and intelligence. Spider-kin are very intelligent and learn languages almost supernaturally quickly. When mixed varieties of spider-kin mate, the offspring are a mix of their mother and father’s type. If, for example, a Drider and arachne were to mate, the resulting brood would be composed of roughly 5-6 arachne and 5-6 Driders, though there can be some variation in the exact amounts.");
			headerSub("Corrupted reproduction");
			outputText("Unfortunately, the rising tide of corruption in the land has affected the ways that spider-kin copulate in more nefarious ways. Those females who have been exposed to high levels of corruption quickly grow large ovipositors from the bottoms of their abdomens, and are capable of laying their corrupted offspring inside the vaginal canals or anuses of their victims. These corrupt spider-kin often drip venom when agitated or aroused, and can poison or arouse with just a kiss. Eggs laid from their tainted ovipositors do absorb personally traits and some modest physical changes from the host-mother, but still hatch entirely as spiders, regardless of the mother’s race. Thankfully, the eggs will induce labor and force themselves from the host mother’s body moments before they are due to hatch. Once laid, the spider-kin young-lings will emerge and skitter off in search of their first meal. \nThough corrupted, these spider-kin aren’t necessarily in league with demons or monstrous in their desires. Simply being exposed to corrupt fluids a few times in short order can have this affect, leaving a mostly pure-hearted spider-girl with a distended, egg-filled ovipositor and the desire to use it. Succubi drafts have also been known to cause this effect in spider-kin, even males.");

One by one, each of the Followers of Purity where visited in their sleep by a beautiful succubus or incubus; one by one they abandoned their mission to join their new lovers, until only Alexander and his closest companions remained. The mission would not fail here though, Alexander and his comrades learned to watch their backs, and to never let any of their members sleep alone. Even then, they no longer had the strength they needed to overcome the demon’s holds on this world’s communities, and Alexander feared his crusade would fail. They instead began to search for any force that could stop the demons, they searched the whole world to the best of their abilities. All the while being hunted by the demons at every turn.

In sufficiently large goo girls, humanoid appearance is taken after initial contact with a suitable creature. Because increasing mass becomes exponentially harder as they grow, most goo girls maintain a volume suitable for a 4-5’ statue, though they may be found smaller or larger according to food supplies.

Fire is highly effective against them, as it dissolves their slimy coating, but it also makes them significantly more acidic, leading to more dangerous counter attacks. Goo girls do not have sexual urges like most humanoids, but love to mimic appearances and behaviors, including suggestive poses, exposing engorged organs, or light masturbations. If they are provided with sufficient demonstrations, a goo girl may ‘succumb’ to lust, and allow the humanoid to explore it instead. If a goo girl is sufficiently threatened, they will eject their heart into the water, leaving an empty shell behind to distract the attacks.

Rather, they often congregate with others of their species and engage in what may appear to be a sexual orgy to the less discerning viewer. The semi-permeable nature of their bodies allows goo girls to ‘merge’ with one another, sharing information between their hearts. It is not unheard of for multiple goo girls to occupy the same body for weeks on end as they explore the world around them together, before splitting off, producing a ‘child’ from their merging. Because it is an equal exchange, there are no negative consequences to this sharing, goo girls naturally develop curious and forceful personalities.

To compensate for the lack of speech, amongst other goo girls, they produce very specific heat signatures. These exothermic pulses serve as a sort of speech, communicating meaning without the necessity of taking the time to merge with one another. Their dogged body exploration may actually be a misunderstanding, explained by the fact that most humanoid creatures cannot self-regulate their body heat and, in situations of excitement, produce additional heat from their genitalia. The goo girls, mistaking this for an invitation to come closer, would be understandably confused and annoyed when the examined creatures respond negatively to slimy pressure that they seemed to be welcoming.");

While goo may be found a distance from a large body of water, it is rare and the lack of moisture tends to turn them highly acidic and a great deal more dangerous. Although it is possible to encounter goo girls with multiple hearts, they do not tend to occupy a single body for very long. There are rumors of “Goo Queens” who have dozens of hearts inside them, using the combined memories and membrane control to become giant, non-permeable, or even capable of speech, depending on the legend. No Goo Queens have ever been reliably identified or reported to date.");

Harpies aren’t stupid and can talk, but they are fantastically lazy when it comes to anything other than seeing to their bodies needs. Since harpies roost on the upper reaches of the mountain, it’s inevitable that they became corrupted quite quickly. Corruption had fairly little effect on the harpies. Sure it boosted their libidos, but that only lead to more frequent masturbation. The most profound effect was a large increase in fertility and massive decrease in gestation time.

As a consequence, the anuses of Lizans are easily comparable in sexual sensitivity and receptiveness to vaginas; because a female Lizan is invariably double-penetrated with even a single male partner, they have evolved to feel just as much pleasure in their anus as in their vagina. Female Lizans typically have smaller breasts; A-cups are the norm in their culture, and few naturally grow above a C-cup. Hermaphrodites have the characteristics of both sexes. This means interspecies relationships with Lizans can be a little awkward; female Lizans often need to invest in toys to stimulate their back passage with when mating with other races, while males and herms can have problems understanding that their partners don’t like anal sex. Many Lizans have a fetish for lactating breasts and/or long hair, because the phenomena is unknown among their kind.");
			headerSub("Corruption");
			outputText("Corruption in Lizans manifests primarily mentally, inducing them towards typically demonic behavior – an erosion of mores, loss of interest in anything besides sex, increasing lack of compassion & empathy, etc. Similarly to the also-oviparous harpies, corrupted Lizans produce eggs more frequently than uncorrupted Lizans, and they also produce much larger clutches. The standard increases to cock and breast size go without saying.");
			headerSub("Diet");
			outputText("Lizans are predominantly carnivorous, though they are omnivorous enough that they can be opportunistic feeders. They traditionally consume their prey raw, in order to cannibalize its juices to hydrate their own bodies – a helpful adaptation in the deserts and hot grasslands where they tend to live.");
			headerSub("Reproduction");
			outputText("Similarly to harpies, Lizans are oviparous; females lay eggs, from which hatch new Lizans – these infants are highly independent and ready to eat meat from when they hatch. As a result, the breasts on a female or herm Lizan are just for show and they do not lactate. Unlike harpies, Lizans actually produce fully-fledged eggs in their womb as part of ovulation – essentially, a pregnant-looking midriff is a sign that a Lizan is now ready to be fertilized, rather than a sign she has been fertilized. If she mates before she goes into labor, then the eggs will remain in the womb for several more days, growing larger as the embryos form inside them, before being laid. The fertilized eggs will be carefully guarded as a “clutch”, with the mother waiting for the fertilized eggs to hatch. If the “pregnant” Lizan doesn’t mate, then the eggs are laid as unfertilized. In this case, the mother traditionally eats them, in order to replenish the depleted nutrients and protein – being offered one of a Lizan’s own eggs to eat is a sign that she finds you very attractive and is interested in mating with you. A Lizan herm or female will typically produce 3 or 4 eggs per clutch, and will produce a clutch every 30 days. Larger clutches aren’t unheard of, especially if the Lizan mates with an extremely virile/potent mate, but typically high fertility manifests in a decrease in the times between laying – normally, this would mean a Lizan grows gravid every 15 days, but in this tainted world it’s possible for a Lizan to make eggs every day. Unfertilized eggs are small, about the size of a chicken’s, while fertilized eggs are considerably larger (think the difference between eggs and large eggs from Ovi Elixir). Like all anthropomorphic Marethian species, Lizans can crossbreed with humans. However, they may be the race most likely to produce mixed bloods (beings that look more like humans with animal traits, such as legs, tails and ears, rather than humanoid animals) instead of pure bloods of one parent's race or the other (usually the anthro's race).");
			headerSub("Culture");
			outputText("There are functionally two different Lizan cultures; that of the desert Lizans, and that of the plains Lizans. Both groups are a contemplative, spiritual culture, offering reverence to the various god-spirits of Mareth that they deem important to their lives, such as their creator-spirit and the spirits of the rain. They typically wear little in the way of clothing; most settle for a loincloth about their nethers, for modesty’s sake, and/or a long hooded cloak to keep the worst of the dust and sun off. Prone to being superstitious, many Lizans adorn themselves with assorted bangles and geegaws, talismans intended to attract good spirits and ward of evil spirits. “Shamans” and similar mystics are quite respected in Lizan culture, and it’s often a position held by the natural-born hermaphrodites. Lizans of the desert are quiet and peaceful by nature, wandering the lands alone or in small, family groups, eternally seeking food and drink to sustain them through the day. Family groups rarely cross paths, but when they do, it is a time to celebrate – often, members of the group will trade, in order to found new families of their own, in time. This is not to say that they are pacifists or cannot fight, merely that they prefer to hold peace. Lizans of the plains, on the other hand, are violent and warlike, which they blame on the constant harassment by their ancient enemies, the gnolls. Gathering in large clans of multiple extended family groups, they place emphasis on breeding and on honing war-like skills; hermaphrodites are honored amongst their culture for their ability to impregnate and be impregnated at the same time. Indeed, if there are too many members of one gender in a tribe, members are exhorted to use gender-modifying items so there can be more phalluses to fertilize eggs with or more egg-generating wombs.");

Oral tradition claims that they were created by a lizard deity who admired the idea the other deities had to uplift the animals of Mareth into humanoid beings, but scorned the idea of uplifting mammals, who he saw as weak and soft. Instead, the spirit chose to uplift the hardy lizards of the plains and the desert.\n");

The plains Lizans, though, are functionally extinct as a pure race; except for some emigrees from early on in the invasion, all plains dwelling Lizans are now at least moderately corrupt, and as hermaphroditism has become quite widespread, their numbers are flourishing.");

Personal reasons for doing so vary widely, but the racial reason is simple; the demons’ preventing of the rain for years and years has caused many deaths among their number and rendered it increasingly hard to survive in the hot, dry regions where they live. The race that desert Lizans most interact with is the cult of the Sand Witches, and the relationship there can be said to be one of love/hate. As noted above, many Lizans find lactating breasts to be a fetish, males and herms appreciate the twin pussies that sand witches possess, and all sexes find the abundance of nutrient-rich fluids that can be sucked from a Sand Witch quite helpful in the dry climates of their home. Sand Witches don’t necessarily mind the attention, and rumors say there are more than a few mixed blood Lizans in the desert as a result, but are fiercely possessive of their milk and fixated on adding new recruits to their cult. As a result, more than one male Lizan has spent at least some time as a lactating shemale as a result of underestimating them. Plains Lizans are defined by their constant war against the gnolls. Lacking individual strength by comparison, they have always depended on numbers to fight back against the hyena-morphs, and thus they have given themselves over to corruption.");

This infantile satyr grows inside the pseudo-womb like a regular infant would in a normal womb, with all of the usual symptoms - distended midriff, strange cravings, increased lust, sensations of movement, etc. When the infant grows large enough, the egg breaks down and the \"mother\" goes into labor, the liquified pseudo-womb serving as lubricant that, combined with the motions of the anal passage, brings the baby satyr into the world.\n");

They are often allied with goblins, one of the few races that can stand to be around them as they are now, with the satyr trading its considerable talents as a stud in exchange for food and liquor. The only reason satyrs as a whole have not sold themselves into slavery to the goblins is because, for many, the ever-increasing supply of willing sluts doesn’t outweigh the fact they can’t breed any sons with goblins.");
