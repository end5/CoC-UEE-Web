She easily reaches you despite the distance gained by your strides, and you receive the device readily.  \"<i>I want you to have this. Merry Christmas, [name].</i>\" You wish her a Merry Christmas in response, though call up blanks when trying to remember her name - It's then you realize that she had never given it in the first place.
