/*Notes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. talk a little to the ponies, aka get to know them a little and their personalities
2. futtershy(yellow one with pink mane) hides in the bushes and you comment of the number of small animals surrounding her
3. rarity(white one with purple mane) comments about your awful dress attire
4.applejack(orange one with sandy blonde mane) asks what are you doing in these parts?
the pink one(pinkie pie) offer to throw a party in honor of our new friend
IF you accept you wake up at you camp groaning from a headache, you definitely drank too much Pony Punch, and all you can remember is bits and pieces of the party, when you inspect yourself you see that your centaur lowerbody changed and looks very similar to the body of the ponies you encountered. You explain that the change may have been caused by the food you ate at the party. You also lose half a foot of height(optional, may not be implemented).
If you don't accept you never encounter them again
the way i explain this one time event is that you accidently stumbled across this place, which is protected by magic. after that you never encounter them again.
