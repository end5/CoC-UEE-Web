	  Boosts Speed stat
	  Ass reduction
	  Testicles return inside your body (could be reverted by the use of succubi delight)
	  Can change penis into reptilian form  (since there's a lot of commentary here not knowing where to go, let me lay it out.)
	 the change will select one cock (randomly if you have multiple)
	 said cock will become two reptilian cocks
	 these can then be affected separately, so if someone wants to go through the effort of removing one and leaving themselves with one reptile penis, they have the ability to do that
	 This also means that someone who's already reached the maximum numbers of dicks cannot get a reptilian penis unless they remove one first
	 "Your reptilian penis is X.X inches long and X.X inches thick.  The sheath extends halfway up the shaft, thick and veiny, while the smooth shaft extends out of the sheath coming to a pointed tip at the head. "
	  Grow poisonous fangs (grants Poison Bite ability to player, incompatible with the sting ability, as it uses the same poison-meter)
	  Causes your tongue to fork
	  Legs fuse together and dissolve into snake tail  (grants Constrict ability to player, said tail can only be covered in scales, independently from the rest of the body)
	  If snake tail exists:
		Make it longer, possibly larger (tail length is considered independently of your height, so it doesn't enable you to use the axe, for instance.
		Change tail's color according to location
		  [Smooth] Beige and Tan (Desert), [Rough] Brown and Rust (Mountains), [Lush]  Forest Green and Yellow (Forest), [Cold] Blue and White (ice land?), [Fresh] Meadow Green [#57D53B - #7FFF00] and Dark Teal [#008080] (lake) , [Menacing] Black and Red (Demon realm, outside encounters), [Distinguished] Ivory (#FFFFF0) and Royal Purple/Amethyst (#702963) (Factory), [Mossy] Emerald and Chestnut (Swamp), [Arid] Orange and Olive pattern (Tel' Adre)

	 9a) Item Description
